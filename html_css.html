  <h1>sports in its entire</h1>
    <p id="whtitis">
    sport is a game or physical activity often competitive and organized,
    Sport competitions may use a team or single person format, and may be open, allowing a broad range of participants, or closed, restricting participation to specific groups or those invited. Competitions may allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure there is only one winner.
